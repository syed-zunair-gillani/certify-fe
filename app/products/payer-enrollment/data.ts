          'What are the different elements and associated turnaround times of payer enrollment?',
        body: "Payer Enrollment consists of two parts: contracting and credentialing. Contracting is the process of executing an agreement with the health plan. This is typically accomplished by submitting an application or request to join form on the health plan website. It takes an average of 30 to 45 days to receive a contract from the health plan once an application is submitted. Credentialing, which can happen either in parallel or sequentially with contracting, is the process by which the health plan will verify that each provider is compliant with the health plan's credentialing policies and prcocedures. This process typically takes between 60 to 90 days.",
